# Parking Optimization System

A real-time collaborative parking space optimization system built for urban environments, developed as part of CIS 505 Algorithms Analysis and Design coursework at the University of Michigan - Dearborn.

## Overview

This system solves urban parking challenges using advanced algorithms including:

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Game theory Nash equilibrium optimization
- **Smart Routing**: A* pathfinding with real-time traffic integration
- **Demand Prediction**: ML-based forecasting with historical analysis
- **City Coordination**: Distributed optimization using divide-and-conquer
- **Driver Psychology**: Behavioral modeling with 6 personality types

## Quick Start

## API Configuration (Optional)

The system works in 100% free mode without any API keys. For enhanced accuracy with real traffic data:

1. **TomTom** (default): Get free key at [developer.tomtom.com](https://developer.tomtom.com/) - 2,500 calls/day free
2. **Mapbox** (alternative): Get free token at [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) - 100k calls/month free
3. **Google Maps** (optional): Setup at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) - requires credit card

```bash
export TOMTOM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Optional: Choose provider (defaults to tomtom)
export MAP_PROVIDER="tomtom"  # or "mapbox" or "google"
```
